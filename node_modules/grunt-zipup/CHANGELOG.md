### 0.1.6 (2013-08-06)

*   Switch to moxie-zip, which seems to reliably fix
    zip file corruption issues I was seeing with other
    libraries (archiver and zipstream).

<a name="0.1.5"></a>
### 0.1.5 (2013-08-05)

*   Fixed a bug where the multitask was not executing
    because the callback was not being invoked.

<a name="0.1.4"></a>
### 0.1.4 (2013-08-05)

*   Fix issues where zip files were occasionally corrupted
    because streams reading from the files into the output
    zip were not being appended correctly.

<a name="0.1.3"></a>
### 0.1.3 (2013-08-02)

*   Replace adm-zip with node-archiver

    adm-zip has a bug which corrupts the zip file for certain
    png files (possibly other file types too):
    https://github.com/cthackers/adm-zip/issues/57

    Added tests which check the generated zip file can be
    extracted, and that it contains the correct content.
